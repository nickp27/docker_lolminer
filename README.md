# docker_lolminer
This is an (early) work in progress docker of lolminer from https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases

I am currently running this on UnRaid (on 6.9RC1) with --runtime=nvidia and the usage and CMD options the same as the standalone version of the miner.

To do:

amend the Dockerfile to allow for rolling updates
provide for environmental variables rather than manual input of algo and pool options
compile an UnRaid template
